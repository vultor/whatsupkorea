			<h2>Rant &amp; Rave: Addresses</h2>
			<h3>Intro</h3>
			<p>
				Here's a cultural difference between Western countries and Asian countries – the address naming system. So, when I first came to Korea, I was up in Bundang, which is a wealthy suburb of Seoul. I was new to Asia, knew I'd be living and working for a year, so I was excited to learn about my new surroundings. I was paying attention to everything and noticed that my apartment and school were on the same, fairly large, 3-lane road. The manager showing me around was a nice Korean guy in his late 20's who spoke English well and seemed intelligent. So, I asked him the name of the road on which my apartment and school sat. He looked at me confused. It's a large road. He works at the school. In my mind, he clearly would know the address of his workplace and thus the name of this road. Even if he didn't know the address of the school, this was obviously a major thoroughfare. Knowing the name seemed obvious. But he didn't. He understood my question – he just didn't know the name of the street. As a consolation he said, “I know the name of the intersection of your apartment.” I found out that the address naming system in Korea (and Japan as well) – called the East Asian naming system – is very different from that of the American, Canadian, and European address naming system – called the Road Name Address System.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Rant</h3>
			<p>
				Koreans have been using the East Asian system for a long time and have grown accustomed to it. Other than the inconvenience to everybody who lives or works somewhere, the change is the worst for the people who use addresses the most. So, who relies on addresses in their daily work? Delivery drivers, taxi drivers, firefighters and police! Many of them have been complaining since January of this year, when the system went into official use because they're having a hard time finding the addresses of the places they need to go. Firefighters and police being dispatched have complained that when they don't immediately know where the new addresses are, so they have to look them up. Then, some say they get multiple addresses around the country with the same street name (presumably because they're not typing in the city where they are). And it takes them longer to get to the address.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's hopefully less of a problem now, but the navigation systems so frequently used by drivers weren't immediately updated, so it has been difficult for people to find addresses. So, all of the navigation devices have to be updated to include BOTH the Road Name system and the East Asian system because it's still in the transition period of which system people know.
				Personal example, when I went to the US Embassy to register my son as a US citizen, I filled out my application with my new address and my Korean wife filled her part out with our old address. The embassy worker asked if we lived at different addresses. We laughed when we realized we had written down different addresses for the same place. Thankfully the worked understood and it wasn't a problem.
			</p>
			<h3>Rave</h3>
			<p>
				So, what's the rave about the new naming system. First of all, it's more logical. If I were Korean, I'd be reluctant to change too. That's human nature. I'd be completely comfortable with the East Asian system and would probably think it ridiculous to have to forget everything I know to learn some seemingly arbitrary new system. But ultimately, it's not arbitrary. Every major road has a name, and every building on the road has a number. Buildings are numbered even on one side and odd on the other. Buildings down small alleyways that are too small to have a name, are given the same house number followed by a hyphen and a unique number. So if you have an address of 23-3 Gwangju-gil, then your house is on Gwangju street, down a small alleyway adjacent to building number 23. It's logical and straightforward.
			</p>
			<p>
				The East Asian system requires you to know where each neighborhood is and often requires you to contact the person you're trying to meet to get more detailed directions to where they live or work. The new system will allow you to find a building by simply following the numbers clearly labeled on the buildings. Though we're still in a transition period now, over time, as the new system is more widely adopted (and not resisted by delivery drivers and taxi drivers), things will become more efficient and easier to find.

			<h2>Rant &amp; Rave: Internet</h2>
			<h3>Intro</h3>
			<p>
				The internet has become an almost indispensable part of modern society. And it's fairly young. Considering in 1993, the internet only transferred 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks. By 2007, that number rose to more than 97%. Basically transmitted information comes from the internet. We use the internet to look up information, keep in touch with people, call people, apply for jobs, shop, watch TV or movies, listen to the “radio”, and tons of other things. In developed countries, if the internet is not a part of your daily life, you're probably a monk. And I've seen monks with smart phones and laptops. So today, we're going to rant and rave about the internet in Korea. But we're going to rave first this time.
			</p>
			<h3>Rave</h3>
			<p>
				As almost everybody in Korea should know, Korea has the fastest internet in the world. And it's not just barely the fastest – it blows other countries away. Really, it's quite amazing considering the ease at which technology can be improved. How can Korea leave other countries like Japan, China, the US, and Germany behind? Korea's average connection speed is 24.6 megabytes per second. In the US it's 11.4 and 10.4 in Canada! Korean internet is literally 115% faster than the US. More than twice as fast on average. That's crazy fast. That means you can stream an HD movie or TV show twice as fast. Every web page you load, will load twice as fast on average than that same page in the US or Canada. It's the same for you UK folks. Your average is similar to the US at 11.1 Mbps. You want to move to Switzerland or the Netherlands to get about 33% faster average internet connection speed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Personally, I do a lot of work on the internet. I'm getting my Masters with a concentration in Digital Media and Instructional Design (basically building websites). I also run a solar energy information website online. So the blazing internet speeds help my productivity in completing my course work and updating my online business.
			</p>
			<h3>Rant</h3>
			<p>
				The blazing speeds aren't without a cost. The Korean government did a great job implementing policies to encourage the widespread access to broadband internet. But it made a mistake in terms of policy regarding using the internet, and it's caused a whole bunch of problems that most Koreans are unaware of.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, have you noticed that almost all Korean websites must be run on Microsoft Internet Explorer? IE is the black sheep of the website building community. All other modern browsers – Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari – have adopted modern standards for rendering code. IE, however, has held out whenever it's wanted to because it has historically had such a large market share. It basically didn't feel the need to change, so in some areas, it has resisted updating. IE still holds more than 56% of browser market share.
			</p>
			<p>
				IE is the slowest of the modern browsers, and the most vulnerable to cyber attacks. All browsers have bugs, and all browsers except IE fix those bugs and release updates as soon as available. IE has a fixed update schedule, so even if they find a vulnerability, they'll wait to release the fix until the next scheduled date – sometimes 5 or 6 months later. So users have to suffer with the vulnerability or bug until then. IE also forces manual updating of Adobe's Flash Player, which is buggy in it's own right and needs updates way too often. Firefox has the same problem, but Chrome quietly and automatically updates Flash for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, the most important reason Korean web surfing is terrible is because of ActiveX. If you've ever tried to do internet banking, make online purchases, or even access user-only areas of Korean websites (think your work portal), you've probably had a pop-up telling you that you need to download an ActiveX control. Then you probably got 2-10 more pop-ups demanding you download all sorts of other programs in order to make the transaction or log in to the Korean site.
			</p>
			<p>
				The mistake the Korean government made was back in the 1990's. They were early adopters of e-commerce, but feared vulnerability to fraud, so they passed a law requiring people to use their national ID in order to make financial transactions online. At the time, it was a great idea. But the problem was that the whole digital certificate system relied on ActiveX. Safer, more user-friendly security measures have been developed, but Korea is still stuck using ActiveX because of this outdated law. Microsoft even officially discourages the use of ActiveX because of all of its vulnerabilities to theft and malware. And Apple, known to computer people as the safest way to access the internet, has never used ActiveX. Which means you basically can't use a Mac in Korea for anything other than checking your email and watching YouTube videos.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully, a recent poll of Korean businesses shows that more than 78% want ActiveX to be discontinued and Park Geun-hye has a group working on developing a new, safe system that doesn't rely on this. When that finally happens, Korea may become a true Internet paradise for geeks.

			<h2>Rant &amp; Rave: Korean Food</h2>
			<h3>Intro</h3>
			<p>
				We're going to talk about an aspect of Korea where there's a lot to rave about: Korean food. Koreans like to rave about kimchi as the epitome of Korean food, but there are tons of other culturally unique Korean dishes of which the global population should be aware. Today, we're ranting and raving about Korean food.
			</p>
			<h3>Rave</h3>
			<p>
				Like many Westerners, I had never had Korean food before I came to Korea. The popularity of Korean food has definitely increased in the last 5-10 years and it's much more common to find well-trafficked Korean restaurants in big cities around the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's start with my favorite. By far, my favorite Korean dish is Chun-cheon Dalk-galbi (춘천 닭갈비). It's basically spicy marinated chicken 'ribs' or rib meat in a vegetable stir-fry. It has lots of cabbage, onions, carrots, ddeok (like rice cakes), red-pepper paste sauce, sesame oil and sesame leaves. It's a popular dish that I think would do really well internationally.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then there's Sam-gyeop-sal (삼겹살), sometimes referred to as Korean bacon. There's not a non-vegetarian Westerner out there who doesn't love sam-gyeop-sal. It's basically strips of pork with 3 layers of fat, grilled on a hot plate. Dipped in a little Gileum-jang (기름장) with a little Ssam-jang (쌈장), and wrapped in a piece of fresh lettuce with a little garlic and onions. Oh yeah. The thicker the better in my opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				From here opinions might vary a bit. I know a lot of people love Bulgogi (불고기), but I'll be honest, I don't think that's one of the best representations of Korean food. I'd go with Ddeok-galbi which is a speciality of both Gwangju and Damyang. I might call it seasoned hamburger steak, but that English name doesn't do it justice. There are quite a few famous restaurants serving Ddeok-galbi in Song-jeong-ri southwest of the airport. But my favorite is a duck version, Ori ddeok-galbi (오리 떡갈비) from a place huddled into the base of Mudeung mountain near Damyang (담양). So delicious and really well done.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then there are all of the soups in Korea that are delicious.
			</p>
			<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
				<li>Byeo hae-jang guk</li>
				<li>Sam gye tang</li>
				<li>Kimchi jjigae</li>
				<li>Doenjang jjigae</li>
				<li>Meori guk-bap</li>
				<li>Ddukbaegi Bulgogi</li>
				<li>Naeng myeon</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				And we can't forget about Korean desserts like Patbing-su, rice cake, and my favorite hoddeok (호떡) which is like a sweet pancake stuffed with brown sugar and peanuts.
			</p>
			<h3>Rant</h3>
			<p>
				So, with all the delicious and unique foods in Korea, it might be difficult to rant. But I think we can find a few.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'd start with Beondegi (번데기) also know as steamed silk worm. I know there a fair amount of people who say they like it, but I don't believe them. I think they're just trying to sound cool. In my classes, I regularly use Beondegi as an example of a food that some people might not like, and inevitably a few students who say they like it. For most Westerners, I think it's fair to say that steamed silk worm is not something they get excited to eat.
			</p>
			<p>
				I used to live in Naju, and there's a festival dedicated to a food I'm not particularly fond of: Hongeo (홍어) or fermented skate fish which is a bottom feeder like a ray. If you've ever smelled this fish, you'd wonder why people would put it in their mouth. There are plenty of Koreans who love this dish, my brother-in-law included. But even the most adventurous Westerner I know didn't enjoy Hongeo when we went to the Naju festival together to try it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another fishy item that probably makes a lot of Westerners crumple their nose is Ojingeo (오징어) usually known as dried squid. This popular Korean snack can sometimes be found at the movie theaters, but I have yet to meet a Westerner who seeks it out as snack. 
			</p>
			<p>
				And the last rant about Korean food, for me at least, would have to be Boshin-tang (보신탕) also known as dog meat stew. Apparently when the 1988 Olympics were coming to Seoul, the city government outlawed Boshin-tang restaurants and made them move to the outskirts of the city so as not to offend the global visitors. Probably since then, many Koreans have been trying to distance themselves from this dish but there are still plenty of more 'traditional-minded' folks, especially men, who enjoy eating dog meat stew. As with many other Korean dishes, it's said to give men more 'stamina'.
